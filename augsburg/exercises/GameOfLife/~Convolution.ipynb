    "In order to illustrate the concept, we use the `scipy.special.convolve` function which allows to perform a convolution on 1d arrays. For the 2d arrays in the game of life, we will make use of `scipy.special.convolve2d`. The following code determines a discrete derivative where each element of the new array `a` is obtained by a difference of the neighboring elements in the original array `b`. We set `mode='same'` to obtain an array of the same length. Missing elements to the left and right of the original array are set to zero. In order to understand how convolution works, take a look at the output of the following code and try to figure out how it is obtained."

    "`boundary='fill'` will fill missing values outside the array with `fillvalue` which by default equals zero. Another choice is `boundary='wrap'` which amounts to applying periodic boundary conditions. Applied to our problem, this choice implies evolving the game of life on a toroidal lattice. In this way, boundary effects can be avoided."
