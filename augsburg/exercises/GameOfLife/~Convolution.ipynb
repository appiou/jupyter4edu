    "In order to illustrate the concept, we use the `scipy.special.convolve` function which allows to perform a convolution on 1d arrays. For the 2d arrays in the game of life, we will make use of `scipy.special.convolve2d`. The following code determines a discrete derivative where each element of the new array `a` is obtained by a difference of the neighboring elements in the original array `b`. We set `mode='same'` to obtain an array of the same length. Missing elements to the left and right of the original array are set to zero. In order to understand how convolution works, take a look at the output of the following code and try to figure out how it is obtained."

    "As mentioned above, elements beyond the array boundaries are set to zero by `convolve`. The two-dimensional version `convolve2d` allows for two different behaviors. `mode='fill'` sets the missing values to `fillvalue` which by default is zero. `mode='fill'` thus behaves in the same way as `convolve`. Another choice is `mode='wrap'` which uses periodic boundary conditions. This is a sensible choice in the game of life by which boundary effects can be avoided."
