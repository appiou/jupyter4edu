    "The [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulates the dynamics of some living species according to a few simple rules devised by the British mathematician [J. H. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway). The dynamics unfolds on a square lattice of cells which can either be populated or unpopulated. The rules for the time evolution are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A populated cell will become unpopulated in the next generation if it has less than two\n",
    "   populated neighbors.\n",
    "1. A populated cell will be populated in the next generation if it has two or three \n",
    "   populated neighbors.\n",
    "1. A populated cell will become unpopulated in the next generation if it has more than    \n",
    "   three populated neighbors.\n",
    "1. An unpopulated cell will become populated in the next generation if exactly three of its  \n",
    "   neighbors are populated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "These rules can be motivated by a minimum of populated neighboring cells needed for reproduction and a maximum of populated neighboring cells to avoid starvation from overpopulation. The rules can be stated in a simpler form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell will be populated in the next generation if\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is presently populated and has two populated neighboring cells\n",
    "* independently of its present state, it has three populated neighboring cells\n",
    "\n",
    "In all other cases, the cell will be unpopulated in the next generation. The update from generation to generation has to be done for all cells in a single step."
