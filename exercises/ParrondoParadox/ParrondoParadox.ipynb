Surprisingly, by choosing an appropriate alternating sequence of the two loosing games, one finds that one wins in the long run. This situation is known as [Parrondo's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrondo's_paradox).\n",

    "* In game A, coin 1 is used with a winning probability $p_1=1/2-\\varepsilon$ where $\\varepsilon>0$. The probability to loose is thus given by $1/2+\\varepsilon > 1/2$.\n",
    "* In game B, two different coins 2 and 3 are used depending on the player's present capital in Euros. Coin 2 has a winning probability $p_2=1/10-\\varepsilon$ and is used when the capital is a multiple of the integer $M$. Otherwise, coin 3 is used which possesses a winning probability of $p_3=3/4-\\varepsilon$.\n",
