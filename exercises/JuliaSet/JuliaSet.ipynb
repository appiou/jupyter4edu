    "Julia sets offer a possibility to generate beautiful images. Instead of going into the mathematical details of Julia sets, we consider a specific situation. More information can be found, e.g. in the [Wikipedia article on Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).\n",

    "We will consider a quadratic mapping of a complex number $z$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  z \\to z^2+c,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $c$ is a complex constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of motivation, let us first consider the case $c=0$. If the absolute value of the initial value, $|z_0|$ is larger than 1, the absolute value of $z$ will go to infinity as the mapping is applied over and over again. On the other hand, for $|z_0| \\leq 1$, the absolute value of $z$ will always remain finite. The border between the two regions is the Julia set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $c\\neq 0$, the Julia set will typically exhibit a much more interesting structure than the unit circle just discussed. While one could plot the Julia set itself, a nicer graphical representation is obtained, if the starting points in the complex plane leading to a diverging series are colored as a function of how fast the divergence is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, we will consider the quadratic mapping given above and set $c=-0.8+0.156\\mathrm{i}$. As complex starting values $z_0$, we choose complex numbers on a regularly spaced two-dimensional grid with the real part in the interval $[-0.3, -0.1]$ and the imaginary part in the interval $[0.4, 0.6]$."
